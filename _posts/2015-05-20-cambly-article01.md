This post is related to the [cambly post][article] about why google plus fail.

# Brief summarize
Google has been trying to get Google Plus more popular than Facebook or Twitter, but
they were wrong because Google Plus was thinking it to companies and not to people.
However a lot of people still using it because is the way to loggin easily all Google
applications online.

Aparently Google is going to find a way to serve as Photo Managing and Streaming Videos
in the future, but maybe I am wrong.

# Why is Google changing its strategy for Google+?
Because the users do not feel like they are using a social network or something like Facebook

# Was Google successful at getting people to talk about Google plus?
No, it was not.

# Google+ was designed to solve the companyâ€™s own problems.
I think this was the big problem with Google Plus, just because they did not think about 
the other people around the world that happend. Maybe becaouse of that Facebook and Twitter
for example have more successful, they had in mind the people's requirements and not only
his own.

# What have been the most successful parts of Google+
Photo Application and Video Streaming
